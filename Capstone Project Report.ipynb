While one of the least populated provincial capital cities with a population base of less than 60 thousand residents, it offers a wide spectrum of venues and is a governement, university and cultural hub.\n\nAs the city grows and develops, it becomes increasingly important to examine and understand it quantitiatively. The City of Fredericton provides open data for everyone and encourages entrepreneurial use to develop services for the benefit of its ciitzens.\n\nThe developers, policy makers and city planners have interests in answering the following questions:\n\n1. What neighbourhoods have the highest crime?\n2. Is population density correlated to crime level?\n3. Using Foursquare data, what venues are most common in different locations within the city?\n4. Does the Knowledge Park really need a coffee shop?"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data\n\nTo understand and explore we will need the following City of Fredericton Open Data:\n\nOpen Data Site: http://data-fredericton.opendata.arcgis.com/\nFredericton Neighbourhoods: http://data-fredericton.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/neighbourhoods--quartiers\nFredericton Crime by Neighbourhood: http://data-fredericton.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/crime-by-neighbourhood-2017--crime-par-quartier-2017\nFredericton Census Tract Demographics: http://data-fredericton.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/census-tract-demographics--donn%C3%A9es-d%C3%A9mographiques-du-secteur-de-recensement\nFredericton locations of interest: https://github.com/JasonLUrquhart/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Fredericton%20Locations.xlsx\nFoursquare Developers Access to venue data: https://foursquare.com/\n\nUsing this data will allow exploration and examination to answer the questions. The neighbourhood data will enable us to properly group crime by neighbourhood. The Census data will enable us to then compare the population density to examine if areas of highest crime are also most densely populated. Fredericton locations of interest will then allow us to cluster and quantitatively understand the venues most common to that location."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Methodology\n\nThe methodology I would use showed below:\n\n1. Loading each data set\n2. Examine the crime frequency by neighbourhood\n3. Study the crime types and then pivot analysis of crime type frequency by neighbourhood\n4. Understand correlation between crimes and population density\n5. Perform k-means statisical analysis on venues by locations of interest based on findings from crimes and neighbourhood\n6. Determine which venues are most common statistically in the region of greatest crime count then in all other locations of interest.\n7. Determine if an area, such as the Knowledge Park needs a coffee shop."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Loading the data:\n\nAfter loading the applicable libraries, the referenced geojson neighbourhood data was loaded from the City of Fredericton Open Data site. This dataset uses block polygon shape coordinates which are better for visualization and comparison. The City also uses Ward data but the Neighbourhood location data is more accurate and includes more details. The same type of dataset was then loaded for the population density from the Stats Canada Census tracts.\n\nThe third dataset, an excel file, \"Crime by Neighbourhood 2017\" downloaded from the City of Fredericton Open Data site is found under the Public Safety domain. This dataset was then uploaded for the analysis. It's interesting to note the details of this dataset are aggregated by neighbourhood. It is not an exhaustive set by not including all crimes (violent offenses) nor specific location data of the crime but is referenced by neighbourhood.\n\nThis means we can gain an understanding of the crime volume by type by area but not specific enough to understand the distribution properties. Valuable questions such as, \"are these crimes occuring more often in a specific area and at a certain time by a specific demographic of people?\" cannot be answered nor explored due to what is reasonably assumed to be personal and private information with associated legal risks.\n\nThere is value to the city to explore the detailed crime data using data science to predict frequency, location, timing and conditions to best allocated resources for the benefit of its citizens and it's police force. However, human behaviour is complex requiring thick profile data by individual and the conditions surrounding the event(s). To be sufficient for reliable future prediction it would need to demonstrate validity, currency, reliability and sufficiency."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Exploring the data\n\nOne note is the possibility neighbourhoods names could change at different times. The crime dataset did not mention which specific neighbourhood naming dataset it was using but we assumed the neighbourhood data provided aligned with the neighbourhoods used in the crime data. It may be beneficial for the City to note and timestamp neighbourhood naming in the future or simply reference with neighbourhood naming file it used for the crime dataset.\n\nAn example of data errors: There was an error found in the naming of the neighbourhood \"Platt\". The neighbourhood data stated \"Plat\" while the crime data stated \"Platt\". Given the crime dataset was most simple to manipulate it was modified to \"Plat\". The true name of the neighbourhood is \"Platt\"."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "First Visualization of Crime\n\n", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
